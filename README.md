# 🦄 Airgap App Store

Airgap App Store (_the product_) is a user interface that facilitates the discovery of UDS Packages and provides detailed information about them. It enables users to make informed decisions regarding the security and contracting status of packages they may want to incorporate into their mission environments.

The team supports the "path to 1000 apps" initiative 🚀, increasing the ability of Mission Heroes to access necessary tools in their required environments through the UDS ecosystem. We aim to lower the barrier for converting existing tools into UDS Packages (_and subsequently make them available in the Airgap App Store) through documented and automated mechanisms.
