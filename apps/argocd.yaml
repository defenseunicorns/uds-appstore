    Argo CD is a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that automates the deployment
    and lifecycle management of applications based on declarative, version-controlled
    configurations. It enables organizations to maintain application definitions,
    configurations, and environments in Git repositories, ensuring auditable and easily
    understandable deployment processes. Argo CD simplifies the management of multiple
    clusters and supports various config management tools, providing a flexible and
    powerful solution for implementing GitOps practices.

    The platform features a web-based UI that offers real-time views of application
    activity and health status analysis. Key features include automated configuration
    drift detection, rollback capabilities, multi-tenancy support with RBAC policies,
    and integration with multiple SSO providers.
