    Jaeger is an open-source end-to-end distributed tracing system, designed for monitoring and troubleshooting the performance of microservices.
    It helps developers understand how requests propagate through their systems, allowing them to identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and enhance overall user experience.
    With Jaeger, organizations can gain insights into their microservices architecture, enabling them to improve application performance and reliability.
    Its robust tracing capabilities facilitate root cause analysis and help maintain service-level agreements (SLAs).
    Jaeger offers a user-friendly interface that visualizes traces and spans, allowing users to easily navigate through transactions.
    Key features include adaptive sampling, support for multiple storage backends, and a rich set of APIs for integration with existing workflows.
    Jaeger integrates seamlessly with various instrumentation libraries and frameworks, including OpenTelemetry, providing a comprehensive solution for distributed tracing.
    It also includes components such as the Jaeger Agent, Collector, and Query service for managing traces and visualizing performance metrics.
