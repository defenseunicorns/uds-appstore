    **The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database**
  description: |
    PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses
    and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale
    the most complicated data workloads. PostgreSQL comes with many features aimed to
    help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and
    build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big
    or small the dataset. In addition to being free and open source, PostgreSQL is
    highly extensible. For example, you can define your own data types, build out
    custom functions, even write code from different programming languages without
    recompiling your database!
