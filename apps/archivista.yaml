    Archivista is a graph and storage service for in-toto attestations, enabling the
    discovery, retrieval, and querying of software artifact attestations. It provides
    a centralized, trusted store for supply chain metadata, allowing users to store,
    retrieve, and query relationships between attestations via a GraphQL API. Archivista
    enhances software supply chain security by creating a queryable graph of metadata
    while storing signed attestations, supporting policy validation without manual
    listing of expected attestations. Archivista integrates seamlessly with major cloud
    service providers and supports various architectures (Darwin, Windows, ARM),
    making it a versatile solution for securing software supply chains across different
    environments.
