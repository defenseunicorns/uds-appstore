    **Clean Code, Under Your Control**

    SonarQube is a comprehensive code quality and security tool that helps developers
    deliver and maintain high-quality, secure code. It performs static code analysis
    to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells across multiple programming
    languages, providing actionable insights to improve code health. By integrating
    seamlessly into development workflows, SonarQube enables teams to catch and fix
    issues early, reducing technical debt and enhancing overall software quality.
    The platform integrates with popular DevOps tools like GitHub, GitLab,
    Azure Pipelines, and Jenkins, allowing for automated code scans and quality checks
    throughout the development process.
