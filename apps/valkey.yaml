    **An Open Source, In-memory Data Store**
  description: |
    Valkey is an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore that supports
    a variety of workloads such as caching, message queues, and can act as a primary
    database. Valkey can run as either a standalone daemon or in a cluster, with
    options for replication and high availability. Valkey natively supports a rich
    collection of datatypes, including strings, numbers, hashes, lists, sets,
    sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and more. You can operate on data structures
    in-place with an expressive collection of commands.
