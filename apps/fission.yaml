    Open source, Kubernetes-native, serverless framework.
    Fission allows developers to write short-lived functions in any language and map them to HTTP requests or other event triggers. No need to manage containers or Docker registries.
    Key benefits include a focus on writing code without managing Kubernetes plumbing and the flexibility of deploying functions on any Kubernetes cluster.
    The interface is simple and declarative, allowing for quick deployments and integration with Kubernetes services. Key features include operational simplicity with built-in logging, metrics, and Istio service-mesh integration.
    Fission integrates with Prometheus, Fluentd, and Kubernetes, and provides wide language support, including Python, NodeJS, Go, C#, and PHP.
