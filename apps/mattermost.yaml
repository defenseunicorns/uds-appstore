    **Collaboration for Mission-Critical Work**

    Mattermost is a secure, open-source collaboration platform designed for teams who
    prioritize data control and privacy. This self-hosted messaging system offers a
    robust alternative to cloud-based chat services, allowing organizations to maintain
    full ownership of their communication data.

    Mattermost is ideal for organizations that require a reliable, secure, and
    customizable team communication solution without compromising on data sovereignty.
    It's particularly well-suited for development teams, security-conscious DoD teams,
    and missions looking to enhance internal collaboration while maintaining control
    over their infrastructure.
