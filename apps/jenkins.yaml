    **Build Great Things at Any Scale**

    Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps you automate the building,
    testing, and deployment of any project across multiple platforms. Jenkins helps
    to avoid breaking changes so that you can save time and ensure the delivery of
    high-quality software. Its web interface provides an easy way to manage and
    test your applications before taking them to production. This image bundles
    the latest versions of community-recommended plugins, including pipelines and
    Git integration.
