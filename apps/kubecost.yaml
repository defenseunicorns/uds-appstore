    Monitor & reduce Kubernetes spend
    Kubecost provides real-time cost visibility and insights for teams using Kubernetes, helping you continuously reduce your cloud costs.
    Kubecost allows you to allocate costs by any Kubernetes concepts, such as deployment, service, namespace label, and more. You can view costs across multiple clusters or API endpoints.
    The tool offers optimization insights by providing recommendations to reduce costs while maintaining performance. You can also receive real-time notifications to catch cost overruns or outage risks.
    Kubecost integrates with external services and tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack to maintain engineering workflows.
